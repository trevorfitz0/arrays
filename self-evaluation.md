How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far? I fell very confident about everything we have learned array wise.
Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson? I do not think there is any.
What questions do you have about Arrays? How big can they get total before breaking a machine!?
Commit your work.
